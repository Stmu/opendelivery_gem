opendelivery_gem
================



Ruby Gem for OpenDelivery. For information on our feature roadmap, go to the [Roadmap](https://github.com/stelligent/opendelivery_gem/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)

==============

## Description

OpenDelivery gem lets you interact with the open delivery components for orchestrating your software delivery using the Open Delivery platform.

While Ruby can be installed on many operating systems, we've included detailed instructions for installing on an AWS linux instance. With minor alterations, you can run these instructions for other operating systems.

## Configuration of AWS Linux instance

Since you will be using [AWS EC2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) to install AWS. You'll need to create an instance using the AWS linux instance. The AMI ID to use is:

```
us-east-1: ami-05355a6c
us-west-1: ami-951945d0
us-west-2: ami-16fd7026
eu-west-1: ami-24506250
sa-east-1: ami-3e3be423
ap-southeast-1: ami-74dda626
ap-northeast-1: ami-dcfa4edd
```

Just launch an instance using the given AMI.

## Create your AWS Config file

```
AWS.config(
:access_key_id => "AKIAISHDASD7MBC7fHA",
:secret_access_key => "vEUt0O/UZkDDC2sa/44wAaZ7uHASDASDbStfgujiInFF",
:region => "us-west-1")
```

## Install Ruby and its dependencies

1. ```yum -y install ruby19```

## Install Opendelivery gem

1. ```gem install opendelivery```
or add it to your gemfile

## Require the gem
Inside your ruby script just require the opendelivery gem
```require 'opendelivery'```
